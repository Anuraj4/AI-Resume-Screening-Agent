# AI Resume Screening Agent â€“ Aprisity Pre-placement Task

## Project Title:
AI Resume Screening Agent

## Project Description:
This project is an AI-powered Resume Screening Agent designed to assist recruiters by automatically analyzing and scoring resumes against a given job description. Users upload their resume file and paste the job description, and the system evaluates how well the resume matches the job requirements, providing a match percentage score.

The project features a sleek, modern web interface with a glassmorphism UI effect and a custom-styled file upload button for an enhanced user experience.
